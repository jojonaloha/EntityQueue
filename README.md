Use at your own risk!
=====================

This is an experimental Drupal module that started as a port of the Nodequeue
module to support any entity. It is no longer in development and has been
abandoned in favor of another implementation that is hosted on Drupal.org. It is
not recommended for production use and is provided as-is.

Alternatives
============

I highly recommend you try and submit any issues or feedback for the actively
developed version of [entityqueue on Drupal.org](https://drupal.org/sandbox/amateescu/1429904)
